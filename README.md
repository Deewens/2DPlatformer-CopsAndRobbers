# Cops and Robbers

Cops and Robbers is a 2D Platformer mobile game. You have just committed a crime and you are wanted by the police. The police are armed and will shoot at you on sight. They also possess drones that are patrolling the area at your research and will shoot at you on sight. Your goal is simply to escape the police through the level, and you have a gun that you can use against the police.

This game has been developed for a college project. The goal was to create a simple game to work on a mobile device and to better understand some Unity features like pathfinding, saving/loading the state of the game, working with the tilemap component, and with some physic components.

## Technologies

The game has been developed thanks to the Unity game engine. We also used the tilemap component of Unity to create the scenes. The game works well on Android mobile phones.
